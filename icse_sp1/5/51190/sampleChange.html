            &#47&#47 we will now have an N x emb_size tensor
            &#47&#47 this is the input to the CNN
            &#47&#47 there are two ways in which this padding is suboptimal
            &#47&#47 the first is that for short sentences, smaller windows will
            &#47&#47   be padded to the point that some windows are entirely pad
            &#47&#47 the second is that a sentence S will have more or less padding
            &#47&#47   depending on what other sentences are in its batch
            &#47&#47 we assume these effects are pretty minimal
