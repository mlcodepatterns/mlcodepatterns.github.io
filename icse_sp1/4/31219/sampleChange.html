        out_df = pd.DataFrame(columns=self._years)
        out_idx = <a id="change">[]</a>
        &#47&#47 For each record_id we&quotve been given:
        for x in X:
            &#47&#47 Find the index associated with the record ID we are predicting
            &#47&#47 a grouping for:
            idx = self._best_of[self._best_of.record_id == x].index.values[0]

            &#47&#47 Mask the best_of dataframe, keeping only those entries where
            &#47&#47 the index of the chosen record_id appears -- this results in a
            &#47&#47 huge dataframe almost full of NaN values.
            w_m = self._best_of[self._years][self._best_of[self._years] == idx]
            &#47&#47 Grab the index values of the rows in the masked dataframe which
            &#47&#47 are NOT all NaN -- these are the indices of the *other* records
            &#47&#47 which found the record x to be one of their best matches.
            w_m = w_m.dropna(how=&quotall&quot).index.values

            &#47&#47 Now look up the indices of the records which were found to be
            &#47&#47 best matches to the record x.
            b_m = self._best_of.loc[idx, self._years].astype(int)

            &#47&#47 Here we require that there is no conflict between the two sets
            &#47&#47 of indices -- that every time a record shows up in a grouping,
            &#47&#47 that grouping is either the same, or a subset of the other
            &#47&#47 groupings that it appears in. When no sufficiently good match
            &#47&#47 is found the "index" in the _best_of array is set to -1, so
            &#47&#47 requiring that the b_m value be &gt;=0 screens out those no-match
            &#47&#47 cases. This is okay -- we&quotre just trying to require that the
            &#47&#47 groupings be internally self-consistent, not that they are
            &#47&#47 completely identical. Being flexible on this dramatically
            &#47&#47 increases the number of records that get assigned a plant ID.
            if np.array_equiv(w_m, b_m[b_m &gt;= 0].values):
                &#47&#47 This line is causing a warning. In cases where there are
                &#47&#47 some years no sufficiently good match exists, and so b_m
                &#47&#47 doesn&quott contain an index. Instead, it has a -1 sentinel
                &#47&#47 value, which isn&quott a label for which a record exists, which
                &#47&#47 upsets .loc. Need to find some way around this... but for
                &#47&#47 now it does what we want. We could use .iloc instead, but
                &#47&#47 then the -1 sentinel value maps to the last entry in the
                &#47&#47 dataframe, which also isn&quott what we want.  Blargh.
                new_grp = self._best_of.loc[b_m, &quotrecord_id&quot]

                &#47&#47 reshape into row, rather than column,
                new_grp = new_grp.values.reshape(1, len(self._years))

                out_df = pd.concat([out_df, new_grp])

                &#47&#47 Save the seed record_id for use in indexing the output:
                <a id="change">out_idx = out_idx + [self._best_of.loc[idx, &quotrecord_id&quot]]</a>
