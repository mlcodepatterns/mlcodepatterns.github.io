    &#47&#47 Using these unassociated_plants, lable all the generators that
    &#47&#47 are a part of plants that have generators that are not included
    &#47&#47 in the bga table

    &#47&#47 Find all the generator records that were ever missing a boiler:
    unassociated_generators = gens[~gens[&quotboiler_generator_assn&quot]]
    &#47&#47 Create a list of plants with unassociated generators, by year.
    unassociated_plants = <a id="change">unassociated_generators</a>.\
        drop_duplicates(subset=<a id="change">[id_col, &quotreport_date&quot]</a>).\
        drop([&quotgenerator_id&quot, &quotboiler_id&quot, &quotboiler_generator_assn&quot], axis=1)
    &#47&#47 Tag those plant-years as being unassociated
    unassociated_plants[&quotplant_assn&quot] = False

    &#47&#47 Merge the plant association flag back in to the generators
    gens = pd.merge(gens, unassociated_plants, how=&quotleft&quot,
                    on=[&quotplant_id_eia&quot, &quotplant_id_pudl&quot, &quotreport_date&quot])
    &#47&#47 Tag the rest of the generators as being part of a plant association...
    &#47&#47 This may or may not be true. Need to filter out partially associated
    &#47&#47 plants in the next step.
    gens[&quotplant_assn&quot] = gens.plant_assn.fillna(value=True)

    &#47&#47 Using the associtated plants, extract the generator/boiler combos
    &#47&#47 that represent complete plants at any time to preserve
    &#47&#47 associations (i.e. if a coal plant had its boilers and generators
    &#47&#47 fully associated in the bga table in 2011 and then adds a
    &#47&#47 combined cycle plant the coal boiler/gen combo will be saved).

    &#47&#47 Remove the report_date:
    <a id="change">gens_complete = gens.drop(&quotreport_date&quot, axis=1)</a>
    &#47&#47 Select only those generators tagged as being part of a complete plant:
    gens_complete = gens_complete[gens_complete[&quotplant_assn&quot]]

    gens_complete = gens_complete.drop_duplicates(subset=[&quotplant_id_eia&quot,</code></pre>
