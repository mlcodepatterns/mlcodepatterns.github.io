    &#47&#47 These invariants ensure that we can restore the source chroot to its original state
    &#47&#47 during post-test cleanup, and that even if that cleanup fails for some reason, the
    &#47&#47 next test run will be able to restore the correct state.
    <a id="change">conftest = os.path.join(
      self.context.products.get_data(GatherSources.PYTHON_SOURCES).path(), &quotconftest.py&quot)</a>
    conftest_orig = None

    &#47&#47 Note that on the first test run since the source chroot was created both invariants hold
    &#47&#47 here: 1 holds because haven&quott ever created conftest_orig, and 2 holds trivially.
    &#47&#47 See below for why both invariants hold here on subsequent runs that complete normally.
    &#47&#47 Note that even if invariant 2 is violated here (say because the previous run crashed before
    &#47&#47 executing the cleanup that restores it) it will be restored in this run&quots cleanup.
    if <a id="change">os</a>.path.exists(conftest):
      conftest_orig = &quot{}.orig&quot.format(conftest)
      if not os.path.exists(conftest_orig):
        &#47&#47 Note that this preserves both invariants.</code></pre><h3>After Change</h3><pre><code class='java'>
    &#47&#47 Note that it&quots important to put the tmpdir under the workdir, because pytest
    &#47&#47 uses all arguments that look like paths to compute its rootdir, and we want
    &#47&#47 it to pick the buildroot.
    <a id="change">with temporary_dir(root_dir=self.workdir) as conftest_dir:
      conftest = os.path.join(conftest_dir, &quotconftest.py&quot)
      with open(conftest, &quotw&quot) as fp:
        fp.write(conftest_content)
