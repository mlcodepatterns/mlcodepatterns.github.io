            &#47&#47 Then we really want to iterate over the sample space.
            &#47&#47
            &#47&#47 There are many ways to do this, but we need to do it in a way
            &#47&#47 that does not rely on the particular implementation&quots storage
            &#47&#47 mechanism.  Here is one way.
            &#47&#47
            outcomes = list(self.sample_space())
            zero = self.ops.zero
            probs = [zero] * len(outcomes)

            _outcomes = self.outcomes
            _pmf = self.pmf
            i, j = 0, 0
            <a id="change">while j &lt; len(_pmf):
                if outcomes[i] == _outcomes[j]:
                    probs[i] = _pmf[j]
                    j += 1
                i += 1
       </a> else:
            outcomes = self.outcomes
            probs = self.pmf
</code></pre><h3>After Change</h3><pre><code class='java'>
            is_null = self.ops.is_null
            &#47&#47 Here we can shortcut and go through outcomes and pmf,
            &#47&#47 while pruning null outcomes.
            <a id="change">for outcome, prob in izip(self.outcomes, self.pmf):
                if not is_null(prob):
                    yield outcome, prob

    &#47&#47&#47&#47&#47&#47 We choose to implement only scalar multiplication and distribution
    &#47&#47&#47&#47&#47&#47 addition, as they will be useful for constructing convex combinations.
    &#47&#47&#47&#47&#47&#47 While other operations could be defined, their usage is likely uncommon
    &#47&#47&#47&#47&#47&#47 and the implementation slower as well.
