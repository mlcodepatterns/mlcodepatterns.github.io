        Create a Carlini L_2 attack instance.

        :param classifier: A trained classifier.
        :param confidence: Confidence of adversarial examples: a higher value produces examples that are farther away,
               from the original input, but classified with higher confidence as the target class.
        :param targeted: Should the attack target one specific class.
        :param learning_rate: The initial learning rate for the attack algorithm. Smaller values produce better results
               but are slower to converge.
        :param binary_search_steps: Number of times to adjust constant with binary search (positive value). If
                                    `binary_search_steps` is large, then the algorithm is not very sensitive to the
                                    value of `initial_const`. Note that the values gamma=0.999999 and c_upper=10e10 are
                                    hardcoded with the same values used by the authors of the method.
        :param max_iter: The maximum number of iterations.
        :param initial_const: The initial trade-off constant `c` to use to tune the relative importance of distance and
                confidence. If `binary_search_steps` is large, the initial constant is not important, as discussed in
                Carlini and Wagner (2016).
        :param max_halving: Maximum number of halving steps in the line search optimization.
        :param max_doubling: Maximum number of doubling steps in the line search optimization.
        :param batch_size: Size of the batch on which adversarial samples are generated.
