    &#47&#47 All generators from the generation_eia923 table, by year.
    gens9 = gen_eia923[<a id="change">[&quotreport_date&quot, &quotplant_id_eia&quot,
                        &quotplant_id_pudl&quot, &quotgenerator_id&quot]</a>].drop_duplicates()

    &#47&#47 Merge in the boiler associations across all the different years of
    &#47&#47 generator - plant associations.
    gens = pd.merge(gens9, bga8, how=&quotleft&quot,
                    on=[&quotplant_id_eia&quot, &quotplant_id_pudl&quot, &quotgenerator_id&quot])
    &#47&#47 Set a boolean flag on each record indicating whether the plant-generator
    &#47&#47 pairing has a boiler associated with it.
    gens[&quotboiler_generator_assn&quot] = \
        np.where(gens.boiler_id.isnull(), False, True)

    &#47&#47 Find all the generator records that were ever missing a boiler:
    <a id="change">unassociated_generators = gens[~gens[&quotboiler_generator_assn&quot]]</a>
    &#47&#47 Create a list of plants with unassociated generators, by year.
    unassociated_plants = unassociated_generators.\

    &#47&#47 Using the associtated plants, extract the generator/boiler combos
    &#47&#47 that represent complete plants at any time to preserve
    &#47&#47 associations (i.e. if a coal plant had its boilers and generators
    &#47&#47 fully associated in the bga table in 2011 and then adds a
    &#47&#47 combined cycle plant the coal boiler/gen combo will be saved).

    &#47&#47 Remove the report_date:
    gens_complete = <a id="change">gens.drop(&quotreport_date&quot, axis=1)</a>
    &#47&#47 Select only those generators tagged as being part of a complete plant:
    <a id="change">gens_complete = gens_complete[gens_complete[&quotplant_assn&quot]]</a>

    gens_complete = gens_complete.drop_duplicates(subset=[&quotplant_id_eia&quot,
