image.

For this calculation, the hard limits of 0 and 1 are not used because
images often have undergone some kind of transformation such that no
pixels ever reach the absolute maximum or minimum of the image format.
Given the noise typical in images, both these measures should be a low
percentage but if the images were saturated during imaging, a higher
than usual *{F_PERCENT_MAXIMAL}* will be observed, and if there are
no objects, the *{F_PERCENT_MINIMAL}* value will increase.

*(Used only if image thresholds are calculated)*

Select *{YES}* to calculate thresholds using all the available
methods. Only the global methods are used.
While most methods are straightfoward, some methods have additional
parameters that require special handling:

-  *{TM_OTSU}:* Thresholds for all combinations of class number,
   minimization parameter and middle class assignment are computed.
-  *Mixture of Gaussians ({TM_MOG}):* Thresholds for image coverage
   fractions of 0.05, 0.25, 0.75 and 0.95 are computed.

See the **IdentifyPrimaryObjects** module for more information on
thresholding methods.
