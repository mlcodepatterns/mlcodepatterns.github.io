            &#47&#47 could possibly happen, but it is not clear exactly what
            &#47&#47 exceptions might arise from a user&quots projection (their
            &#47&#47 rendition of the Axis object).  So, we catch all, with
            &#47&#47 the idea that one would rather potentially lose a tick
            &#47&#47 from one side of the axis or another, rather than see a
            &#47&#47 stack trace.

            &#47&#47 invalid numpy calculations that may be the result of out of
            &#47&#47 bounds on axis with finite allowed intervals such as geo
