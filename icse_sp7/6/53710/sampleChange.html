        positives = tf.to_float(tf.reduce_max(y_true[:,:,1:-8], axis=-1)) &#47&#47 Tensor of shape (batch_size, n_boxes)

        &#47&#47 Count the number of positive boxes (classes 1 to n) in y_true across the whole batch
        n_positive = <a id="change">tf.reduce_sum(positives)</a>

        &#47&#47 Now mask all negative boxes and sum up the losses for the positive boxes PER batch item
        &#47&#47 (Keras loss functions must output one scalar loss value PER batch item, rather than just
        &#47&#47 one scalar for the entire batch, that&quots why we&quotre not summing across all axes)
        pos_class_loss = tf.reduce_sum(classification_loss * positives, axis=-1) &#47&#47 Tensor of shape (batch_size,)

        &#47&#47 Compute the classification loss for the negative default boxes (if there are any)

        &#47&#47 First, compute the classification loss for all negative boxes
        neg_class_loss_all = classification_loss * negatives &#47&#47 Tensor of shape (batch_size, n_boxes)
        n_neg_losses = tf.count_nonzero(neg_class_loss_all, dtype=tf.int32) &#47&#47 The number of non-zero loss entries in `neg_class_loss_all`
        &#47&#47 What&quots the point of `n_neg_losses`? For the next step, which will be to compute which negative boxes enter the classification
        &#47&#47 loss, we don&quott just want to know how many negative ground truth boxes there are, but for how many of those there actually is
        &#47&#47 a positive (i.e. non-zero) loss. This is necessary because `tf.nn.top-k()` in the function below will pick the top k boxes with
        &#47&#47 the highest losses no matter what, even if it receives a vector where all losses are zero. In the unlikely event that all negative
        &#47&#47 classification losses ARE actually zero though, this behavior might lead to `tf.nn.top-k()` returning the indices of positive
        &#47&#47 boxes, leading to an incorrect negative classification loss computation, and hence an incorrect overall loss computation.
        &#47&#47 We therefore need to make sure that `n_negative_keep`, which assumes the role of the `k` argument in `tf.nn.top-k()`,
        &#47&#47 is at most the number of negative boxes for which there is a positive classification loss.

        &#47&#47 Compute the number of negative examples we want to account for in the loss
        &#47&#47 We&quotll keep at most `self.neg_pos_ratio` times the number of positives in `y_true`, but at least `self.n_neg_min` (unless `n_neg_loses` is smaller)
        <a id="change">n_negative_keep = tf.minimum(tf.maximum(self.neg_pos_ratio * tf.to_int32(n_positive), self.n_neg_min), n_neg_losses)</a>

        &#47&#47 In the unlikely case when either (1) there are no negative ground truth boxes at all
        &#47&#47 or (2) the classification loss for all negative boxes is zero, return zero as the `neg_class_loss`
