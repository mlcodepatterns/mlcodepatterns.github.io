Select *{O_TWO_CLASS}* if the grayscale levels are readily
distinguishable into foreground (i.e., objects) and background. Select
*{O_THREE_CLASS}* if there is a middle set of grayscale levels
that belongs to neither the foreground nor background.

For example, three-class thresholding may be useful for images in which
you have nuclear staining along with a low-intensity non-specific cell
staining. Where two-class thresholding might incorrectly assign this
intermediate staining to the nuclei objects, three-class thresholding
allows you to assign it to the foreground or background as desired.
However, in extreme cases where either there are almost no objects or
the entire field of view is covered with objects, three-class
thresholding may perform worse than two-class.
