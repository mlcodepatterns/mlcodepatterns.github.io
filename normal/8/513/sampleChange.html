    non_self_loop_edges = [e for e in all_edges if e[0] != e[1]]

    &#47&#47 get a single copy of each self-loop edge (ie, if it&quots bi-directional, we
    &#47&#47 ignore the parallel edge going reverse direction to keep only one copy)

    &#47&#47 get one copy of each self-loop edge, because bi-directional self-loops
    &#47&#47 appear twice in the undirected graph (u,v,0 and u,v,1 where u=v), but
    &#47&#47 one-way self-loops will appear only once
    Gu = <a id="change">G.to_undirected(reciprocal=False, as_view=True)</a>
    self_loop_edges = set(nx.selfloop_edges(Gu))

    &#47&#47 get all non-self-loop undirected edges, including parallel edges
    non_self_loop_edges = [e for <a id="change">e</a> in Gu.edges(keys=False) if e not in self_loop_edges]

    &#47&#47 make list of all unique edges including each parallel edge unless the
    &#47&#47 parallel edge is a self-loop, in which case we don&quott double-count it</code></pre>
