<html><h3></h3><h3>Before Change</h3><pre><code class='java'>

    &#47&#47 Contains the one-to-one mapping of EIA plants to their operators, but
    &#47&#47 we only have the 860 data integrated for 2011 forward right now.
    plants_eia860 = <a id="change">pd.read_sql(
        &quot&quot&quotSELECT * FROM plants_eia860&quot&quot&quot, pudl_engine)</a>
    plants_eia860 = plants_eia860[[&quotyear&quot, &quotplant_id&quot, &quotoperator_id&quot]]

    &#47&#47 For the PUDL Utility & Plant IDs, as well as utility & plant names:
    utils_eia = pd.read_sql(&quot&quot&quotSELECT * FROM utilities_eia&quot&quot&quot, pudl_engine)</code></pre><h3>After Change</h3><pre><code class='java'>
    pt = models.PUDLBase.metadata.tables
    &#47&#47 Most of the fields we want come direclty from Fuel Receipts & Costs
    frc_tbl = pt[&quotfuel_receipts_costs_eia923&quot]
    <a id="change">frc_select = sa.sql.select([frc_tbl, ])</a>
    frc_df = pd.read_sql(frc_select, pudl_engine)

    &#47&#47 Need a year column to merge with EIA860 data which is annual.
    frc_df[&quotyear&quot] = pd.to_datetime(frc_df[&quotreport_date&quot]).dt.year</code></pre>
