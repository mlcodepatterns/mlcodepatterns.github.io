<html><h3></h3><h3>Before Change</h3><pre><code class='java'>
    &#47&#47 we limit pending submissions to the number of pool workers.  This gives us a bounded number
    &#47&#47 of items to check for submission readiness, ie: we&quotll never need to scan more than the pool
    &#47&#47 size, commonly the number of cores, no matter the size and shape of the execution graph.
    for promise, plan in <a id="change">execution_graph.walk()</a>:
      pending_submission[promise] = plan
      submit_satisfied_pending()
      &#47&#47 Saturate the pool before we block on a result for maximum processing parallelism.</code></pre><h3>After Change</h3><pre><code class='java'>
    &#47&#47 1. Whenever we don&quott have enough work to saturate the pool, request more.
    &#47&#47 2. Whenever the pool is not saturated, submit currently pending work.
